Task 0.  First, let's start with a user wanting to access your website, www.foobar.com. When a user types www.foobar.com into their web browser, the domain name system (DNS) will translate that domain name into an IP address. In this case, the DNS record for www.foobar.com will point to the server's IP address, 8.8.8.8.

Next, let's talk about the components of this infrastructure. A server is a computer system that provides services to other computers over a network. In this case, we will use a single server to host our website.

We will need a web server, which will be Nginx. Nginx will handle incoming web requests from users and route them to the appropriate application server.

We will also need an application server to run our code base. The application server will receive requests from the web server and return dynamic content generated by the application.

Our code base will be stored on the application server. This will include all the necessary files to run the website, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any server-side code.

Lastly, we will need a database to store and manage our website's data. In this case, we will use MySQL. The application server will communicate with the database to read and write data.

Explaining some specifics features about this infrastructure:
Server: A server is a computer program or a physical computer that provides a service to other devices or programs on a computer network.

When someone refers to a "server" in the context of the Internet, they usually mean a physical computer that is connected to the Internet and provides services to other computers or devices. These services can include hosting websites, storing data, providing email services, or running applications that can be accessed by other devices on the network.

Role of domain name: 
Here are some specific roles of a domain name:

1: Identifying a website: A domain name serves as an identifier for a website on the Internet. When a user types a domain name into their web browser, the browser uses the domain name to look up the IP address associated with the domain and connect to the server hosting the website.

2: Branding: A domain name can be an important branding tool for businesses and organizations. It can convey the name or identity of the company and help establish a strong online presence.

3: SEO: A domain name can also play a role in search engine optimization (SEO). A relevant and keyword-rich domain name can help improve a website's visibility in search engine results pages.

4: Email addresses: A domain name can be used to create email addresses for the website or organization. For example, an email address like info@domain.com can be used to communicate with customers or clients.

5: Ownership and control: A domain name provides ownership and control over the website and its content. The domain owner has the authority to make changes to the website, move it to a different server or hosting provider, and control access to the website.

What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com:
The "www" in the URL "www.foobar.com" is not a DNS record, but rather a subdomain of the domain "foobar.com".

In DNS (Domain Name System), a domain is a hierarchical naming system that provides a human-readable name for an IP address. Each domain can have multiple subdomains, which can themselves have subdomains, forming a tree-like structure.

The DNS record associated with a domain or subdomain is called the "DNS A record", which maps the domain or subdomain to an IP address. For example, the DNS A record for "foobar.com" might map to the IP address "123.45.67.89".

To map a subdomain like "www" to an IP address, a separate DNS A record would need to be created for the subdomain. The DNS A record for "www.foobar.com" would map the subdomain to the same or a different IP address than the DNS A record for "foobar.com".

So, to answer the original question, there is no specific DNS record for "www" in "www.foobar.com". It is simply a subdomain of the domain "foobar.com".

Role of the web server:
Here are some specific roles of a web server:

1: Serving static and dynamic content: A web server serves both static and dynamic content. Static content includes HTML pages, images, videos, and other files that are served as they are. Dynamic content is generated on the server side and may include customized HTML pages, data-driven content, and web applications.

2: Handling requests and responses: A web server handles incoming requests from clients and sends back responses. This includes parsing the HTTP request, determining the appropriate content to return, and formatting the response in the HTTP protocol.

3: Managing web traffic: A web server manages web traffic by handling concurrent requests from multiple clients, prioritizing requests, and distributing requests across multiple servers in a load-balanced environment.

4: Security: A web server provides security features to protect the web content and its users. This includes SSL/TLS encryption, authentication mechanisms, and access control.

Role of the application server:
Here are some specific roles of an application server:

1: Running web applications: An application server provides the runtime environment in which web applications run. It manages the application lifecycle, from initialization to shutdown, and handles requests and responses between the application and the web server.

2: Managing data access: An application server manages the flow of data between the application and the database. It provides a framework for developers to write code that interacts with the database and handles transactions, security, and caching.

3: Scaling applications: An application server provides tools for scaling web applications to handle increasing loads. This includes load balancing, clustering, and failover mechanisms to ensure high availability and performance.

4: Security: An application server provides security features to protect the application and its data. This includes authentication and authorization mechanisms, SSL/TLS encryption, and role-based access control.

Role of the database:
The role of a database is to provide a central location for storing and organizing data in a way that is easily accessible to authorized users. This data can include user information, product information, orders, messages, and more.

Databases are used to power dynamic websites, where the content changes based on user interactions or other factors. They allow for the storage and retrieval of information quickly and efficiently, which is critical for websites that need to handle a large amount of data and serve it up to users quickly.

Web applications and websites can use different types of databases, such as relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, and non-relational databases like MongoDB and Cassandra. The choice of database depends on the specific needs of the application and the type of data that needs to be stored and retrieved.

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website:
When a user requests a website, the server communicates with the user's computer using a protocol called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The server sends an HTTP response to the user's computer, which includes the requested webpage and any associated files such as images or videos. The user's web browser then interprets the HTML and displays the webpage to the user.

HTTP is the primary protocol used for communication between web servers and clients, but there are other protocols such as HTTPS (HTTP Secure) that add an extra layer of encryption and security to the communication. Additionally, there are other protocols such as FTP (File Transfer Protocol) that can be used for transferring files between a server and a client.

Now let's talk about the issues with this infrastructure. Firstly, this infrastructure has a single point of failure (SPOF). If the server were to fail, the website would be inaccessible. 
Secondly, when maintenance is required, such as deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted, which will result in downtime. 
Lastly, this infrastructure cannot scale if there is too much incoming traffic.

To address these issues, we can implement some solutions. For example, we could use multiple servers with load balancers to distribute incoming traffic and prevent a single point of failure. We could also use containerization technology, such as Docker, to easily deploy and manage updates without causing downtime. Lastly, we could use cloud infrastructure, such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, to easily scale our infrastructure as needed.
